# Submission Reminder Application

This project is a simple shell-based submission reminder tool designed for managing student assignment submissions.

## Ì≥Ç Application Overview

The application is structured into:
- `create_environment.sh` ‚Äî creates the directory structure and files for the reminder app.
- `copilot_shell_script.sh` ‚Äî updates the assignment name in the config file and re-runs the reminder app.
- `startup.sh` (auto-generated by `create_environment.sh`) ‚Äî starts the reminder system.

## Ì≥å How to Use

1. **Run `create_environment.sh`**
   - Prompts for your name.
   - Creates a `submission_reminder_{YourName}` directory with all app components.
   - Populates necessary files dynamically.

2. **Run `copilot_shell_script.sh`**
   - Enter a new assignment name.(Git, Shell Navigation ...)
   - It updates the `config.env` inside your app directory and re-runs the reminder app.

## Ìª†Ô∏è Git Workflow

- `draft/feature`: Development and rough work.
- `main`: Contains only:
  - `create_environment.sh`
  - `copilot_shell_script.sh`
  - `README.md`

## Ì≥ë Notes

- All files are created dynamically at runtime for portability.
- No absolute paths; fully relative and self-contained.
